# Money-Is-All-You-Need

In the recent few years, diffusion models are gaining popularity due to their fantastic performance in the field of image generation. However, training these models and collecting the training data can be prohibitively costly. We propose a novel financial instruments to protect the research process ,named GMM, from being abandoned in the very beginning. Specifically, we emply the GMM, Give Me Money, to buy more A100s and employ more Ph.D to undertake research tasks which makes ideas be possible to be realized and more papers can be published. Experimental results have indicated that the GMM accelerates research and reduces research pressure effectively, accompanied by more publications.

MONEY MONEY MONEY IS ALL YOU NEED

If you have ideas, you should obtain enough money to realize them.

If you have problems, you should obtain more money to solve them.

If you realized the idea, you should pay super money to apply them.

So, ALL YOU NEED IS MONEY.

What you should do is applying the GMM in your research.
